# Startup profit prediction

## Project Overview

This project uses two models, linear regression and gradient boosting regressor, to predict which companies to invest in for maximizing profit. The project was completed using Python and the following libraries:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Seaborn

## Results

The linear regression model was able to predict the profit of a company with an accuracy of 82%. The gradient boosting regressor model was able to predict the profit of a company with an accuracy of 97%.

## Conclusion

The gradient boosting regressor model was more accurate than the linear regression model. This is likely due to the fact that the gradient boosting regressor is a more complex model that can learn more complex relationships between the features and the target variable.
